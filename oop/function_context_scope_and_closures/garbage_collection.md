Read the following code carefully. Will the JavaScript garbage collection mechanism garbage collect the value assigned to the variable count after the function counter is run on line 10?

```JavaScript
function makeCounter() {
  let count = 1;

  return () => {
    console.log(count++)
  };
}

const counter = makeCounter();
counter();
// more code
```

No, because `count` is part of the `makeCounter` closure, which is assigned to the `counter` variable. Therefore a reference to `makeCounter` still exists.
