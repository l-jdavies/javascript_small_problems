Small Code Challenge Problems
  - 20 - 45 minutes
  - typical solutions: 10 - 40 lines of code
  - used extensively in interviews for a reason
    - mastery of a language
    - logic / reasoning
    - communications
  - not a skill that you "acquire and file away", but needs a lot of practice

Understand the Problem
  - requirements are explicit
    - take notes
    - the "odd words" problem
  - requirements are not so explicit and need to be modeled
    - examples need to be described in computational words
    - "diamond of stars"
  - implicit knowledge needs to be captured
    - convert to explicit rules, in computational language
    - "what century is that"
  - identifying and defining important terms and concepts
    - "queen attack"
    - same row; same column; especially same diagonal
  - ask questions to verify your understanding!

Examples / Test Cases
  - Input / Output
  - Test cases serve two purposes:
    - help you understand the problem
    - allow you to verify your solution
  - Happy paths
    - combination of requirements; the "obvious" result
  - Edge cases
    - focus on input
    - emptiness (nil/null, "", [], {})
    - boundary conditions
    - repetition / duplication
    - upper case / lower case
    - data types
  - Failures / Bad Input
    - raise exceptions / report errors
    - return a special value (nil/null, 0, "", [], etc.)
  - ask questions to verify your understanding!
