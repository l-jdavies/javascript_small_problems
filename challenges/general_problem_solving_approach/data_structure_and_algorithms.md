Data Structure
  - input data
  - rules/requirements as data
    - hash/object

  - string, array, hash/object, number
    - string
      - concact, strip, reverse, etc.
      - Regular Expression! split, replace, match...
    - array
      - need to walk through it (iteration)
      - index
      - abstractions!!
        - map
        - reduce
        - select/filter
        - all
        - ...
    - hash/object
      - lookup table / dictionary
      - partition data for more efficient access downstream
      - digest
    - number
      - math operations
      - number as string may have advantage over numbers
  - compound data structures
    - array of arrays
    - hash with array/object values, etc.

Algorithm
  - algorithms have to be described in the language of chosen data structure!
    - "then solve it" doesn't count
  - have to be really fluent with
    - String / Regex
    - Array
      - Ruby: Enumerable
      - JavaScript: Higher-Order Functions
    - Hash / Object
      - Creation (default values)
      - Access (default values)
      - Iteration
  - verify your algorithm with your examples / test cases
