// Caroline has written a very simple function, includesFalse, that searches a list of primitives for the boolean false. If false is found, the function immediately returns true. If no occurrence of false has been found after iterating through the entire array, the function returns false.

// Caroline's last method invocation of includesFalse (line 15) doesn't return what she expects. Why is that? Fix the code so that it behaves as intended.

function includesFalse(list) {
  for (let i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
    let element = list[i];

    if (element === false) {
      return true;
    }
  }

  return false;
}
// returns:
includesFalse([8, null, 'abc', true, 'launch', 11, false]);       // true
includesFalse(['programming', undefined, 37, 64, true, 'false']); // false
includesFalse([9422, 'lambda', true, 0, '54', null]);             // true

// The function is using the non-strict equality operator to determine if a value is false. This results in `0` being classed as the boolean `false`, based on falsy rules. The strict equality operator `===` should be used instead.
